# Touhou Game Selector

I have created this application as i am working on making an arcade cabinet for Touhou Project. I wanted a way to be able to launch the games using just the cabinet buttons. 
Keyboard and mouse will only be needed for the initial setup. I thought it would be nice to share it with the public. The code is a bit dirty but it works and i plan on optimizing the code in future.
